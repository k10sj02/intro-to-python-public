Files contain the programs below: 
- **Lab-1_Python-Programs-Savings-Calculator-Coin-Changer-Time-Converter.ipynb**: The code in the provided Jupyter Notebook cells includes three Python programs. The first calculates the balance of a savings account with a 4 percent annual interest rate over 1, 2, and 3 years based on the initial deposit. The second determines the optimal denominations of coins to dispense for a given amount of change, while the third converts a number of seconds into the format D:HH:MM:SS, with leading zeros for hours, minutes, and seconds.
- **Lab-2_Temperature-Converter-and-Pi-Approximation.ipynb**: The Python script in this file consists of two programs: The first program converts Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit, displaying the conversion in a tabular format for temperatures ranging from -10°C to 90°C. The second program iteratively approximates the value of Pi using a series expansion method, providing each approximation in the console.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors_Main-Version.ipynb**: This Python script enables a player to engage in a game of rock, paper, scissors against the computer. The game continues until either the player or the computer achieves a winning score of three rounds. It prompts the player to enter their choice and randomly selects a choice for the computer. The script then determines the winner of each round based on the game rules and displays the final outcome, declaring either the player or the computer as the winner or announcing a tie if both scores are equal.
- **Rock-Paper-Scissors_Alternative-Version.ipynb**: This Python script simulates a game of rock, paper, scissors between a human player and the computer. It prompts the player to enter their choice and randomly selects a choice for the computer. The game continues until either the human or the computer wins three rounds, and it displays the outcome of each round along with the final scores tallying the number of wins for both the human and the computer.
